## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
To ensure a well-structured development process, I followed these steps:

1. Created user stories, capturing the desired features and functionalities of a holiday planning app from a user's perspective. You can refer to the image below:

2. Developed a user flow chart to map out the app's workflow and the general process users would go through when using it. Please see the image below:

3. Designed initial website layouts through sketches to establish the app's visual structure. Here's an example:

## :sob: Lessons learnt
Throughout the development process, I gained valuable insights and learned important lessons, such as:

- Setting realistic expectations and avoiding scope creep.
- Taking sufficient time to understand the inner workings of each component rather than rushing for a quick setup, leading to subsequent fixes and adjustments.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
I have exciting features planned for the future of TripWise, including:

- Integrate additional MUI features to enhance the app's visual appeal.
- Enable users to edit their trip lists.
- Allow users to customise trip names according to their preferences.
- Incorporate budget management capabilities.
- Include sections for flights, hotels, car rentals, cruises, and restaurants.

- Save the budget alongside each trip for better financial planning and tracking during travel.
